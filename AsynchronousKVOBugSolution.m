The solution involves ensuring that KVO notifications are sent only after the asynchronous operation completes and the object is in a consistent state. This can be achieved by using a dispatch queue or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the setter method updates the observed property and sends the KVO notification atomically.

```objectivec
@implementation MyClass

- (void)setMyValue:(NSString *)newValue {
    _myValue = newValue;
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        // Perform asynchronous operation
        [self performAsynchronousOperationWithCompletion:^(BOOL success) {
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
              // Ensure that the changes happen on the main thread before sending KVO notifications to avoid inconsistencies. 
                [self willChangeValueForKey:@"myValue"];
                _myValue = newValue; // Assign Value Again (Incase of asynchronous failure)
                [self didChangeValueForKey:@"myValue"];
            });
        }];
    });
}

- (void)performAsynchronousOperationWithCompletion:(void (^)(BOOL success))completion {
    // Simulate asynchronous operation
    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(1 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
        completion(YES);
    });
}

@end
```
By performing the KVO notification only after the asynchronous task completes on the main queue, we guarantee data consistency and avoid potential crashes.
