In Objective-C, a subtle bug can occur when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) with custom setter methods that perform asynchronous operations.  If the asynchronous operation completes *after* the observer's `observeValueForKeyPath:` method is called, the observer might receive stale data or even crash if it tries to access objects that have been deallocated. This is particularly problematic if the setter method modifies the observed object's state before the asynchronous operation completes, and the KVO notification happens while the object is in an inconsistent state.
